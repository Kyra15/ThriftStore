  - ~~search func~~
  - logout (a later thing probs)
###  item page
  - HTML/CSS/JS
  - adding from stock (use andrey's func)
  - removing from stock (use andrey's func)
  - carry over logout func
  - ASK ANDREY FOR SQL DATABASE INSTEAD OF PKL FOR STOCK?
###  login page

## KNOWN PROBLEMS:
  - Inventory:
    - Issues with priority with filtering, currently does an "or" operation instead of "and" to find intersection
    - Spacing and sizing is really weird: when there's only a few items item boxes get super big
