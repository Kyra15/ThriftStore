# ThriftStore

## Sprint 3:
  - CSS + HTML for website
  - Integrate with Andrey's pre-existing html/css
###  inventory page
  - HTML/CSS/JS
  - filtering by size, type, and price
  - search func
  - logout
###  item page
  - HTML/CSS/JS
  - adding from stock (use andrey's func)
  - removing from stock (use andrey's func)
  - ASK ANDREY FOR SQL DATABASE INSTEAD?
###  login page
  - HTML/CSS/JS
  - logging in
  - ASK FOR SQL DATABASE

## KNOWN PROBLEMS:
  - Inventory:
    - Issues with priority with filtering, currently does an "or" operation instead of "and" to find intersection
    - Spacing and sizing is really weird: when there's only a few items item boxes get super big
